Project Title: Git and GitHub Mastery Project

Step1:- Install git by using the following link https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Create a GitHub account by using email and password 
(I have already created the account on git and github.)

After installing VSCode established the github on desktop and using mingw(desktop) and gitbash(in Vscode terminal) we can run the git commands.

For establishing the git in desktop we need to add the login credentials as follows:
–config global username:
–config global email: 

Step2:- 
(i) Create a new repository on GitHub.Name of the GitHub repository should be your name-Learning-Git
=> Repo:- Kashish-Learning-Git 
Repo Link:-  https://github.com/Kashish0223/Kashish-Learning-Git
(ii) Clone the repository to your local machine.
 => 
(iii) Set up Git configurations (username, email, etc.).
=> 

Step3:- 
(i) Create a new branch named "feature-branch" from the main/master branch.

(ii) Make changes to a file (e.g., add, modify, delete).
-> A file is created and modified
(iii) Add your changes to the staging area.

(iv) Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.




(v) Push your changes to the remote repository.



Step4:- 
(i) Create a new branch named "collaborator-branch" from the primary/master branch.


(ii)  Make conflicting changes to the same file in both branches.
=> I apologise mam I have make conflict in main branch and the collaborate branch but I follow the same steps please consider it.
I made the conflicts in the README.md file.

(iii)  Merge the "feature-branch" into the main/master branch.


(iv) Resolve any merge conflicts that arise.
By removing the addition markers like(<<<<<, ===== etc.)

Step5:- 
(i)  Use Git checkout to switch to a previous commit.


(ii)  Use Git reset to undo the last commit.



(iii)  Use Git revert to undo a specific commit.


Step6:- 
(i) Create a pull request from "collaborator-branch" to main/master.



(ii)  Fork a repository from another user's account. (Fork this repo - https://github.com/Tanvi-Ambre/Movie_Search)
Forked the repository.

(iii) Create a new branch in the forked repository.


(iv)  Make changes and create a pull request to the original repository.



Step7:- 
(i) Use the Git Lens extension in Visual Studio Code to visualize Git history.

Install the Git lens.
